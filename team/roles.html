        The <strong>Crowded Group</strong> is a community and without people we wouldn't be where we are today. As the saying goes,
        many hands make light work, and we need many people to help keep our community vibrant and a place people want to return.
        Our goal is not to make everyone happy, but to make it a place where they feel like their presence is meaningful. If you're
        interested in helping in that way, take a look at the roles and responsibilities we have below and reach out to the admins
        if you feel like you might be a good fit.

      <p>
