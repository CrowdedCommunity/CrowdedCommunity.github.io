    We're a small (but growing!) community of geeks who just
    wanted a digital place to hang out with other geeks and talk about what we
    love.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here you will find people with diverse interests such as:

    <dl>

     <dt>Video Games</dt>
     <dd>
       There is a lot of Destiny 2 talk going on, but there are also people
       playing Fortnite, PUBG, and many other games.
     </dd>

     <dt>Programming</dt>
     <dd>
       Whether you want to throw some ideas off someone else, discuss something
       you found interesting, or simply join in on the banter of the Ruby vs PHP
       debate we collectively have over 20 years of programming experience (but
       we won't do your homework for you!)
     </dd>

     <dt>Space</dt>
     <dd>
       We're fans of the final frontier! We reguraly watch live streams of
       SpaceX launches and even on occasion get together to watch past launches
       together on YouTube.
     </dd>

     <dt>TV</dt>
     <dd>
       We're living in the second golden age of television and we're here to talk
       about it all! We have fans of science fiction, Game of Thrones, Rick and
       Morty and more! If you don't find a channel, tell an admin and we'll get
       it created for you!
     </dd>

     <dt>Rage</dt>
     <dd>
       Are you angry about something? Feel free to shout it into the void with
       our very own rage channel! It's very theraputic!
